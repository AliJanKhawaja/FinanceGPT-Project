Finance GPT - January 2, 2025

Greetings,

Welcome to the latest edition of Finance GPT, your AI-generated source for timely market insights. Here’s a recap of today’s financial highlights and key market movements:

The first trading day of the year has proven to be a challenging one for U.S. markets. The NASDAQ and S&P 500 extended their losing streaks to five consecutive sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the fourth straight day. Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit dealt a blow to the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Net Neutrality rules. On a more optimistic note, oil prices surged, reaching $73.31—its highest level since mid-October 2024.

Tesla’s struggles dominated today’s news. The electric vehicle (EV) giant experienced its first annual sales drop in over a decade, with global vehicle sales declining by 1.1% in 2024. This marks Tesla’s first such decrease since 2011, as the company contends with slowing demand, aging models, and aggressive discounting that has eaten into its margins. Analysts suggest that Tesla’s period of unchecked hype and minimal competition may be over. In a separate incident, a rented Cybertruck, loaded with fireworks, exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The explosion resulted in seven injuries and one fatality, with authorities investigating the event as a potential terrorist attack. Despite this setback, Tesla’s long-term prospects in AI and autonomous technology remain a key focus for many analysts, who continue to view any temporary slump in sales as minor in the grand scheme of the company’s ambitious future goals. Tesla’s stock closed the day down 6%, marking its fifth consecutive session of declines.

Other noteworthy movements in the market included Carvana, whose shares dropped by 1.87% following allegations from Hindenburg Research of $800 million in undisclosed loan sales and accounting manipulation, leading to a shift in investor sentiment. Cloudflare saw a 4.51% rise after Goldman Sachs issued a double upgrade, raising its price target from $77 to $140 due to improved sales productivity and new growth opportunities. Uber’s stock rose by 5.01% after Goldman Sachs added it to its U.S. conviction list, citing strong growth potential and profitability, despite a downgrade from JMP Securities over autonomous vehicle competition. Interactive Brokers saw a 3.66% increase following a report of a 66% year-over-year increase in daily average revenue trades (DART) for December and a 33% growth in client equity, which led to a price target hike from Barclays to $214. Lastly, SealsSQ Corp surged by 40.98% after announcing a new satellite-as-a-service model in partnership with WISeSat, which promises secure IoT data transmission and automation, fueling strong investor optimism.
