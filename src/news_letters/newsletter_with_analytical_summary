**Date: Wednesday, April 23, 2025**

Markets rallied on Wednesday, lifted by a wave of optimism early in the day, though the gains were ultimately tempered by conflicting economic signals. The S&P 500 surged nearly 4% in the morning after news broke that the White House had smoothed tensions with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and hinted that tariffs on Chinese imports might be halved. However, the enthusiasm cooled after Treasury Secretary Bessent walked back those remarks, warning that trade negotiations with China could drag on for two to three years. His comments cast a shadow over the day’s rally, though equities still closed solidly higher. The S&P 500 ended the day at 5,376, up 1.67%. The Nasdaq climbed 2.50% to close at 16,708, boosted by gains in tech and semiconductor stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.07% to 39,607, and the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.53% to 1,919.

Technology stocks led the charge, with the AI and semiconductor sectors particularly strong following solid earnings results. ServiceNow, Texas Instruments, and Lam Research were among the day’s biggest gainers, each benefiting from renewed investor confidence in AI demand. ServiceNow jumped 9% after posting earnings of $4.04 per share on $3.09 billion in revenue, exceeding expectations on both fronts. Its subscription revenue rose 19% year-over-year, and the company reported $10.3 billion in future obligations for its AI products, a 22% increase that reflects growing adoption across industries.

Texas Instruments, often associated with calculators but also a major semiconductor player, posted first-quarter earnings that beat estimates by approximately $160 million in revenue. The company forecast up to $4.5 billion in chip sales for the second quarter. When asked if increased demand was linked to concerns about incoming tariffs, management declined to speculate, stating that customers hadn’t provided specific reasons for higher orders. Lam Research, a key provider of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, also beat expectations and projected $5 billion in revenue for the current quarter. Shares rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading.

Not all tech firms joined the rally. IBM saw its stock drop more than 5% after hours, despite reporting a modest 1% rise in revenue to $14.54 billion. The company’s earnings declined, highlighting continued challenges in translating AI ambitions into financial results for some legacy firms.

Boeing had a surprisingly strong showing, with shares climbing 5% despite posting a $31 million net loss for the quarter. That loss was a significant improvement over the $355 million shortfall reported in the same quarter last year. The aerospace giant delivered 130 aircraft, up 57% from the prior quarter, and announced the $10.6 billion sale of its navigation division to investment firm Thoma Bravo. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed confidence in the company’s trajectory, brushing off concerns about Chinese delivery disruptions and stating that Boeing would prioritize customers who are ready to take delivery. He also noted that Boeing was working with regulators to raise the production cap on its 737 Max jets, which was lowered after a high-profile incident last year.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve released its latest Beige Book, a survey of regional economic conditions across the U.S. While overall activity remained steady, the report noted rising prices and an uptick in consumer spending as people rushed to buy goods ahead of potential tariffs. However, the outlook for future economic growth weakened significantly, with businesses growing more cautious about the months ahead.

In summary, the day brought a blend of renewed AI enthusiasm, improved—but still shaky—industrial earnings, and a wary economic outlook. Investors continue to navigate a market driven by technology optimism and geopolitical uncertainty, with key sectors like semiconductors offering hope even as global trade tensions loom. FinanceGPT will be watching closely as earnings season continues and new policy developments unfold.
