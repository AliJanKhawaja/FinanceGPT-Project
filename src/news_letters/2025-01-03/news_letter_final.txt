Dear Readers,

Welcome to the first edition of FinanceGPT for 2025. Today’s markets have demonstrated a strong start to the year, with investors renewing their focus on last year’s top performers. Major indices posted solid gains, signaling optimism as we move into the first quarter. The S&P 500 rose by 1.26% to close at 5,942, the Nasdaq climbed 1.77% to 19,622, the Russell 2000 advanced 1.72% to 2,268, and the Dow Jones finished at 42,732, up 0.80%.

Investors are doubling down on last year’s winners, with clean energy, crypto, and tech stocks leading the charge. Clean hydrogen tax credits from the Biden administration sparked a rally in nuclear energy stocks like Oklo, NuScale, Vistra, and Constellation Energy. Oil and gas stocks also gained traction, bolstered by rising crude prices. Meanwhile, shares of crypto-related companies like MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital surged alongside Bitcoin’s recovery, despite a rocky start to the year for spot ETFs.

Tech remains a focal point for investors, with Nvidia shares jumping 5% ahead of CEO Jensen Huang’s highly anticipated CES 2025 presentation. The company is expected to reveal its next-generation GeForce RTX 5000 graphics cards. Adding to the tech sector’s momentum, Microsoft announced plans to invest $80 billion in AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025, reinforcing optimism around artificial intelligence and cloud technologies. Similarly, commercial drone companies like Ondas Holdings made headlines after its subsidiary, American Robotics, secured an FAA waiver for advanced drone operations. Robotics, drones, and aerospace innovations remain key themes driving investor interest.

Commodities, too, have captured attention, with live and feeder cattle futures reaching all-time highs. A combination of pandemic-driven feed costs, drought-induced herd reductions, and high financing rates has left the U.S. cattle population at its lowest in decades. Adding to supply pressures is a ban on cattle imports from Mexico. Despite these challenges, strong consumer demand for premium beef, fueled by the robust U.S. economy, continues to drive prices higher. Investors looking to capitalize on this trend may consider the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund ($DBA), which provides partial exposure to cattle and other agricultural commodities.

Among today’s standout market moves, Cerence Inc. soared by 142% after expanding its partnership with Nvidia to enhance AI vehicle technologies. Rivian climbed 24% on news of strong production and delivery numbers for the fourth quarter, meeting its revised guidance for 2024. SuperCom saw a 16% jump after securing contracts to improve public safety monitoring in Kentucky. On the other hand, Anheuser-Busch fell 3% following an advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General linking alcohol consumption to increased cancer risks, while U.S. Steel dropped 5% after the Biden administration blocked its $15 billion acquisition by Nippon Steel.

As we close out the first trading week of 2025, the market’s focus on innovation, sustainability, and recovery remains clear. Whether it’s clean energy, advanced technology, or commodities, this year’s early trends suggest continued investor interest in last year’s leaders.

Warm regards,
