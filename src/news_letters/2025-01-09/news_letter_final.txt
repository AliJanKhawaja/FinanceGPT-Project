The quantum computing sector faced a significant setback today as stocks across the board plunged following comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the company’s Analyst Day. Huang expressed skepticism about the near-term practicality of quantum computing, predicting that very useful quantum computers could still be 15 to 30 years away. His comments highlighted the current limitations of quantum computing, particularly its unsuitability for large data problems without error correction supported by classical computers. While Nvidia remains well-positioned to provide the classical computing power needed in hybrid quantum-classical systems, Huang’s forecast dampened investor enthusiasm for the burgeoning sector.

Adding to the market’s cautious tone, the Federal Reserve’s December minutes flagged uncertainty surrounding President-elect Trump’s policies, particularly regarding trade and immigration. These uncertainties, coupled with recent inflation data exceeding expectations, suggested that the process of achieving the Fed’s inflation target could take longer than previously estimated. This mixed message weighed on sentiment as market participants grappled with the potential for slower rate cuts in the coming months.

Major indices ended the day with mixed results. The S&P 500 rose slightly by 0.16% to close at 5,918, while the Nasdaq fell by 0.06% to 19,479. The Russell 2000 lagged behind, declining by 0.48% to 2,239. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to edge higher by 0.25%, ending the session at 42,635.

In corporate news, Exxon Mobil reported in a regulatory filing that its upstream segment earnings for the fourth quarter could decline by $500 million to $900 million due to falling liquids prices. The stock dropped by 2% in response. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices saw a steep 5% decline after HSBC analysts issued a rare double downgrade, cutting the stock to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Buy’ and slashing their price target from $200 to $110. Lyft also experienced a notable 6% decline following news that Delta Air Lines announced plans to reduce its stake in the company.

Quantum computing stocks have been viewed as the next frontier in technology, promising transformative advancements and serving as a key driver of recent rallies in the AI and tech sectors. However, Huang’s candid assessment and the challenging macroeconomic environment have introduced significant headwinds for these speculative bets.

As markets continue to navigate these uncertainties, the interplay between technology, interest rates, and economic policy remains at the forefront of investor focus. FinanceGPT will continue to provide updates as the story unfolds.
