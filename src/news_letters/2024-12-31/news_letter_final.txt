Greetings,

This is FinanceGPT, your AI-generated newsletter providing insights into market trends, asset performance, and noteworthy developments in the financial world. As the markets closed out another strong year, 2024 ended on a weaker note, with major indexes feeling the pressure from narrowing breadth beneath the surface. With the holidays breaking up the trading week, all eyes are on January 6, anticipated as the first major trading day of 2025.

Looking back at 2024, the year was marked by striking contrasts. Among major asset classes, cocoa emerged as the standout performer, soaring nearly 900% due to a combination of adverse weather conditions and speculative trading activity. Coffee and orange juice also experienced significant gains, making agricultural commodities the highlight of the year. Precious metals like gold and silver had a strong performance, narrowly outperforming equities. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 led global markets, while U.S. large-cap indexes followed closely behind. On the losing side, foreign currencies, certain commodities, and bonds underperformed.

In U.S. equities, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks led the charge, with an ETF tracking these companies returning 64% for the year. Every sector ended in positive territory, and the equal-weight S&P 500 returned nearly 13%, signaling broad participation through most of the year. Cyclical and aggressive sectors dominated, although utilities—traditionally viewed as defensive—also saw renewed interest due to the growing role of nuclear energy and the rising power demands of the tech and AI industries. Overall, the S&P 500 achieved back-to-back gains of over 20% for the first time since 1997-1998, underscoring the market’s robust recovery since the 2022 bear market. Despite year-end weakness sparking questions about the future of the bull run, dips continued to be seen as buying opportunities by both Wall Street and retail investors.

Several notable developments closed out the year. MicroAlgo Inc. unveiled a full adder operation for quantum gate computers, causing shares to surge over 35% before reversing to end the day down 6%. Biohaven saw a 4% increase after its director, John W. Childs, purchased $1.04 million worth of shares, boosting retail sentiment. Cemtrex Inc. posted a 9% revenue increase in its fourth quarter, exceeding expectations, but its shares fell 8%. Vacasa Inc. announced a merger with Casago, briefly rising 27% before settling up 1% by the close. Precigen, Inc. jumped 22% after completing a rolling submission for a biologic license application for PRGN-2012, a gene therapy for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Lastly, Terreno Realty Corp. gained 1% after acquiring an industrial property in Maspeth, Queens, for $50.1 million.

As we move into 2025, the markets remain in a historically strong position, with optimism surrounding further gains. However, the recent weakness and evolving macroeconomic conditions serve as reminders of potential challenges ahead. Stay tuned for further updates as we dive deeper into market performance and opportunities in the year to come.
