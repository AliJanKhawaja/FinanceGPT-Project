Equity markets on Monday faced significant volatility driven by unconfirmed reports of a potential 90-day tariff pause. The S&P 500, initially down nearly 4%, surged over 3% into positive territory, resulting in a $6 trillion shift in equity valuation. The White House later denied the tariff pause, and President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to tariffs, threatening a second wave of 50% levies on China, prompting the market to retrace its gains. The VIX peaked at 60, reflecting high uncertainty. By the close, the S&P 500 stood at 5,062, down 0.23%, the Nasdaq was slightly up at 15,603, the Russell 2000 fell nearly 1%, and the Dow closed at 37,966, down 0.91%.
The tariff rumor originated from Kevin Hassett’s appearance on Fox and Friends, where his remarks were misinterpreted on financial Twitter, sparking speculation about a tariff pause. CNBC, Reuters, and Bloomberg reported the unconfirmed news, with CNBC noting it was unverified. Hassett later clarified he made no definitive comment on the pause. Bloomberg attributed part of the market’s surge and fall to financial influencers like @DeItaone, while CNBC acknowledged airing the unconfirmed report but corrected it quickly.

Corporate commentary added context to the market’s movements. Jamie Dimon’s annual shareholder letter for JPMorgan highlighted concerns about inflationary pressures from tariffs and a potential decline in consumer spending. Morgan Stanley issued a sector-wide downgrade for large and mid-cap banking stocks ahead of Q1 earnings. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, speaking at the Economic Club of New York, noted that 62% of Americans are invested in the stock market, emphasizing the broad impact of market downturns. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cut price targets for Tesla and Apple by 43% and 23%, respectively, citing tariff impacts on their China-based supply chains.

Individual stock movements were mixed. JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) gained 2%, while Palantir ($PLTR) rose 5% despite a temporary trading halt due to volatility. Broadcom ($AVGO) jumped 9% after announcing a $10 billion share buyback program. BYD Co. ($BYDDF) fell 8% after announcing its European market entry with its Denza luxury brand priced at $78,000. Nio Inc. ($NIO) dropped 5% amid news of CATL’s potential acquisition of a controlling stake in its power unit. General Motors ($GM) declined 1% after Bernstein downgraded it from ‘Market Perform’ to ‘Underperform,’ cutting the price target from $50 to $35. US Steel ($X) rallied 16% after President Trump ordered a reevaluation of a pending deal by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Spirit Airlines ($SAVEQ) rose 0.4% amid CEO Ted Christie’s announced departure from the Board of Directors. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals ($RYTM) surged 17% after positive clinical trial results for its weight-loss drug targeting rare obesity caused by MC4R pathway deficiencies. iBio ($IBIO) plummeted 56% after releasing animal study results for its experimental antibody, criticized for lacking statistical rigor and study design flaws. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Q1 results came out yesterday, reporting earnings
per share of $2.12 against the street’s estimate of $2.07, showcasing continued strength in AI
spending by mega-cap firms, even with tariff uncertainties looming.

Interestingly, Musk himself seemed to signal discomfort with the tariff strategy. Over the weekend, he appeared at an Italian political convention and voiced strong support for free trade, indirectly criticizing U.S. Trade Advisor Peter Navarro. Navarro responded sharply, dismissing Musk’s stance and asserting that the current round of tariffs was only the beginning. He went so far as to pen an article for the Financial Times defending the administration’s position, arguing that the U.S. must protect its economic interests at all costs. The back-and-forth added another layer of political drama to an already tense economic atmosphere.

In terms of individual stock movements, Monday was a mixed bag, characterized by erratic behavior in both directions. JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) saw a modest 2% gain, likely buoyed by Dimon’s shareholder letter which, despite its warnings, reiterated the bank’s long-term resilience. Palantir ($PLTR) stood out as a major winner with a 5% gain, even as it triggered a temporary trading halt due to high volatility. The company’s contract work with the Department of Defense often lends it immunity from broader market sentiment, and it managed to rally in a sea of red.

Broadcom ($AVGO) impressed with a 9% jump following the announcement of a massive $10 billion share buyback program scheduled to run through year-end. The move was interpreted as a strong show of confidence by management and a way to return capital to shareholders amid uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Conversely, Chinese EV firms struggled. BYD Co. ($BYDDF) fell by 8% after announcing plans to enter the European market with its Denza luxury brand. The $78,000 price tag for its vehicles raised eyebrows in a price-sensitive environment. Nio Inc. ($NIO) also dropped 5% on news that Chinese battery giant CATL was in talks to purchase a controlling stake in Nio’s power unit, leading to speculation about the latter’s financial stability and future direction.

General Motors ($GM) was hit with a downgrade by Bernstein analysts, dropping 1% after the firm lowered its rating from ‘Market Perform’ to ‘Underperform’ and slashed its price target from $50 to $35. US Steel ($X), on the other hand, saw a dramatic 16% rally after President Trump ordered the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to reevaluate a pending deal. This was perceived as a protectionist move favorable to domestic manufacturers, prompting a buying frenzy in steel-related equities.

In the latest market developments, Spirit Airlines ($SAVEQ), a low-cost carrier navigating the complexities of bankruptcy protection, experienced a modest uptick of 0.4% in its stock price. This marginal increase comes amid significant corporate changes, most notably the announcement that CEO Ted Christie will step down from the company’s Board of Directors. Investors appear to have interpreted this leadership transition as a potential signal of progress in Spirit’s ongoing restructuring efforts. The airline, grappling with financial challenges exacerbated by operational constraints and a highly competitive industry, has been under scrutiny as it seeks to stabilize its balance sheet and chart a path toward recovery. While the slight stock bump reflects cautious optimism, analysts suggest that the market remains wary of the airline’s long-term prospects, with many awaiting concrete updates on its bankruptcy proceedings and strategic overhaul.

In the biotechnology sector, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals ($RYTM) emerged as a standout performer, with its stock surging an impressive 17% following the release of promising clinical trial data. The company announced positive results for its experimental weight-loss drug, which targets a rare form of obesity caused by genetic deficiencies in the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway. The trial demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing body weight among patients with this condition, a group that has historically faced limited treatment options. Investors responded enthusiastically to the news, viewing the drug as a potential breakthrough in the niche but growing market for precision obesity treatments. Rhythm’s success underscores the broader market’s appetite for innovative therapies addressing unmet medical needs, particularly in the weight-loss space, which has seen heightened interest following the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide.

Conversely, not all biotech companies enjoyed favorable market reactions to their clinical updates. iBio ($IBIO), a small-cap biotech focused on plant-based biologics, saw its stock plummet by a staggering 56% after releasing results from an animal study for its experimental antibody. While the company framed the data as positive, investors and analysts were quick to highlight significant shortcomings in the study’s design and execution. Notably, the trial involved only a single administration of the antibody, raising questions about the durability of its effects. Furthermore, the announcement lacked critical details on statistical rigor, such as p-values or confidence intervals, which are essential for validating preclinical results. The absence of robust data, combined with the study’s limited scope, led to widespread skepticism about the antibody’s therapeutic potential and iBio’s ability to advance it toward human trials. This sharp sell-off reflects the high-risk, high-reward nature of early-stage biotech investments, where investor confidence hinges on transparent and compelling scientific evidence.

These divergent outcomes highlight the varied dynamics at play in today’s market, where corporate governance changes, clinical trial outcomes, and investor sentiment can drive significant stock price movements. For Spirit Airlines, the focus remains on navigating its bankruptcy process and restoring operational stability. In the biotech sector, companies like Rhythm Pharmaceuticals are capitalizing on the promise of precision medicine, while others, like iBio, face the consequences of failing to meet the market’s stringent expectations for scientific credibility. As these stories unfold, investors continue to parse through complex data and corporate developments to identify opportunities and risks in an ever-evolving financial landscape.

In sum, Monday’s market action underscored just how fragile investor sentiment has become in 2025. A single misinterpreted quote led to a $6 trillion swing in equities, reflecting a market environment dominated by speculation, headline-chasing, and algorithmic trading. While the day will not go down in history alongside the original Black Monday, it serves as a stark reminder of the systemic risks posed by misinformation, high-frequency trading, and policy uncertainty. As tariffs continue to hang over the global economy and the political climate becomes increasingly volatile, both institutional and retail investors may need to brace for more turbulence ahead. Markets are no longer just moved by fundamentals or earnings—they are increasingly driven by narratives, perception, and the viral spread of information. And in that kind of environment, even a whisper can cause a roar.
