It was a big week for the markets — if you do not zoom out too far. Powered by tariff drama, rapid policy shifts, and early corporate earnings, the S&P 500 closed up more than 5% in its best weekly performance since 2023. The Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 also posted solid gains. However, the U.S. Dollar Index climbed 3%, and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply by 11%, indicating that not all signs point to stability beneath the surface. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 5,363, up 1.81%; the Nasdaq ended at 16,725, up 2.06%; the Russell 2000 closed at 1,860, up 1.57%; and the Dow Jones finished at 40,213, gaining 1.56%. Technology stocks led the market with a 3.98% gain, while real estate trailed slightly, down 0.54%.
The week began with heavy fears of a global recession after China retaliated against new U.S. tariffs. Financial news and social media buzzed with terms like “Black Monday 2.0” as investors braced for the worst. A misquoted tweet suggesting a 90-day tariff pause sent markets temporarily soaring by $6 trillion, only for the White House to quickly deny it, causing a reversal. The official announcement on Tuesday of 104% tariffs on China shook markets further, sending bond yields soaring and causing long-term Treasury notes to sell off at a pace not seen in decades. On Wednesday, after a brief period of turmoil, President Trump formally announced a real 90-day tariff pause, igniting a historic one-day rally. The S&P 500 climbed 9.52%, the Nasdaq surged 12.16%, and the Dow posted its biggest one-day point gain in history. However, optimism faded by Thursday and Friday as investors processed that even with a pause, high tariffs remained in place across critical industries. Though markets closed the week on a positive note, many investors remained cautious heading into the next quarter.
Meanwhile, investors sought safer assets, pushing gold to new all-time highs and fleeing U.S. Treasury bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield posted its largest weekly rise since 2001, raising concerns about the growing cost of U.S. debt. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 3%, as investors shifted toward alternatives like the Euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen. Speculation grew that China, a major foreign holder of U.S. debt, may have been selling Treasuries as part of the trade conflict, although official confirmation remains elusive. Inflation data took a backseat to tariff news this week, but there were signs of relief: Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index numbers showed slight deflation for March. However, University of Michigan survey results showed consumer sentiment remained weak, and one-year inflation expectations rose above 6%, the highest level since the 1980s.
Large banks kicked off the first-quarter earnings season on Friday, and results were largely better than expected. Wells Fargo reported earnings per share of $1.39, beating forecasts but revealing declining revenue and warning of continued volatility and a slower economy in 2025. Morgan Stanley exceeded expectations with earnings per share of $2.60, and its leadership expressed cautious optimism about mergers and acquisitions, despite client hesitation. BlackRock reported earnings per share of $11, with assets under management reaching a record $11.58 trillion, though CEO Larry Fink emphasized his belief that the United States may already be in a recession. JPMorgan Chase topped forecasts with earnings per share of $5.07 and revenue of $45.3 billion, but CEO Jamie Dimon warned that tariffs and trade tensions could create "considerable turbulence" for the global economy.
While the market’s rally this week was historic in scale, many of the underlying risks remain unresolved. Rising bond yields, de-dollarization pressures, and ongoing uncertainty around tariffs suggest that volatility is far from over. Both working professionals and students should stay attentive to new developments, recognizing that despite impressive short-term gains, the path ahead could remain highly unpredictable.
