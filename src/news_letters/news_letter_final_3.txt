Greetings,

The markets returned from the Easter weekend in a somber mood on Monday, with all major United States indexes closing sharply lower. Despite strong performances in safe haven assets like gold and Bitcoin, investor sentiment was weighed down by renewed political tensions and mounting concerns around Federal Reserve leadership.

The S&P 500 slid 2.36 percent to close at 5,158, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.55 percent to finish at 15,871. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.48 percent to 38,170, marking one of its worst one-day performances this year. The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller-cap stocks, also declined by 2.14 percent to close at 1,840. Analysts point to a confluence of post-holiday trading fatigue, global market closures due to Easter, and political rhetoric from former President Donald Trump as key contributors to the day’s downturn.

Gold prices surged to an all-time high of $3,404 per ounce, now up nearly 30 percent year-to-date. Bitcoin also climbed, reinforcing the current trend among investors to pivot toward alternative assets amid broader economic uncertainty. The U.S. Dollar Index fell to 98.30—its lowest level since March 2022—underscoring growing global skepticism about the Federal Reserve’s stability and leadership.

A major driver of market jitters came from Trump’s continued public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Over the weekend, Trump criticized Powell’s pace on rate cuts, calling him “Mr. Too Late” and a “major loser.” While legal experts note that a president cannot unilaterally remove a sitting Federal Reserve chair, Trump’s rhetoric has sparked fresh worries about the Fed’s independence. Barclays analysts responded by downgrading their dollar forecast, signaling that global investors are reassessing America’s status as a financial safe haven. Helen Given, a foreign exchange trader at Monex, warned that threats to Powell’s position could erode confidence in the dollar as a global reserve currency.

Meanwhile, this week marks the beginning of a crucial earnings season for major technology firms, known collectively as the "Magnificent Seven." Tesla leads the pack, with its earnings report scheduled for Tuesday. The electric vehicle company’s stock tumbled 7 percent on Monday, and has now lost 36 percent of its value since the start of the year. Analysts are calling this quarter a make-or-break moment for Tesla. According to a note from Wedbush Securities, investors want to see Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk refocus on the company full-time. Some, including lead analyst Dan Ives, fear that Musk’s political ventures and association with cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin may have permanently damaged Tesla’s brand. Wedbush warned that up to 20 percent of future demand could be lost if Musk does not restore investor and customer confidence.

Tesla’s first-quarter deliveries fell 13 percent year-over-year, with just 336,681 units shipped—its weakest quarter in two years. Still, Wedbush maintains an "outperform" rating on the stock, citing Tesla’s long-term potential as one of the most disruptive technology firms in the world. Expectations compiled by Bloomberg forecast Tesla’s earnings per share to come in at $0.44, down from $0.45 a year ago. Revenue is projected to rise slightly to $21.43 billion. Investors are also eager to hear updates on self-driving vehicle development, new affordable models, and how global trade dynamics might impact production.

Looking ahead, markets are eyeing the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data due next week. Until then, uncertainty around central bank leadership, earnings volatility, and geopolitical tension will likely dominate trading behavior.

As always, FinanceGPT will continue to monitor these developments closely.
